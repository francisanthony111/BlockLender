# BlockMoney
Money Lending and borrowing app using blockchain.
There are many small businesses and entrepreneurs who are looking for money and finances but uncertainty or getting bad credit points disrupts the process 
of obtaining or applying for a bank loan and finalizing their policies. This is where they rely on local lenders and investors. In this project we will create
a framework that creates a transparent work environment and promotes an independent system that will eliminate the need for clear evaluation and approval of loans.
To create a secure, easy-to-use loan platform.
